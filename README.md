<h2>Code</h2>
Made while teaching programming. This application does not include any external libraries other than what Java provides. The game runs one loop at 20 frames per second which handles logic, drawing, audio, & rendering, respectively. Logic is mostly contained inside the program's: "World", "Constants", "Hud", & "Application" files. The graphics utilize the BufferedImage and Graphics2D from Java. Most images are loaded from sprite sheets, the rest is internal. Audio is handled via Clip from Java. The program keeps all sound effects loaded and only loads one music piece at a time. This keeps the program light-weight and hopefully compatible with older machines.
